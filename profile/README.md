# MCREATOR EXAMPLES
A Unofficial place for NorthWestTrees's Tutorials for the application called MCreator.  
  
You can find many of the newer tutorials from my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@NorthWestTreesGaming) on the [Projects](https://github.com/MCreator-Examples/Projects/discussions) Repository discussion page.  
  
Feel free to suggest tutorial on my YouTube channel or directly on the [Feedback](https://github.com/MCreator-Examples/Feedback) Repository issue tracker page.  
  
Of course this would not be possible without the software [MCreator](https://mcreator.net/)
