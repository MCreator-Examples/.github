# ABOUT US
MCreator Examples is the official place for [NorthWestTrees MCreator](https://www.youtube.com/@NorthWestTreesMCreator) YouTube channel to post example workspaces and assets for the MCreator community. We also have a repository for people to request tutorials that we go through when we are low on ideas for things to work on. GitHub provides us with a free way to distribute examples of workspaces to the community for the tutorials we make on our YouTube channel. It makes searching for content a lot easier for people.

# ABOUT MCREATOR
MCreator is an open-source application that anyone including kids can use to make Minecraft mods. Many people use the [MCreator software](https://mcreator.net/) as a stepping stone to branch into learning programming languages. I have personally known many people who have started with MCreator and moved up to programming their mods. Though some people decide to move forward the software still provides a lot of freedom to create complex mods with no coding know-how.
