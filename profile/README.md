# ABOUT US
MCreator Examples is the official place for [NorthWestTrees MCreator](https://www.youtube.com/@NorthWestTreesMCreator) YouTube channel to post example workspaces and assets for the MCreator community. We also have a repository for people to request tutorials that we go through when we are low on ideas for things to work on. GitHub provides us with a free way to distribute examples of workspaces to the community for the tutorials we make on our YouTube channel. It makes searching for content a lot easier for people.

# ABOUT MCREATOR
MCreator is an open-source application that anyone including kids can use to make Minecraft mods. Many people use the [MCreator software](https://mcreator.net/) as a stepping stone to branch into learning programming languages. I have personally known many people who have started with MCreator and moved up to programming their mods. Though some people decide to move forward the software still provides a lot of freedom to create complex mods with no coding know-how.

# REPOSITORIES
## üìÅ PROJECTS
The [Project Repository](https://github.com/MCreator-Examples/Projects) is the place where I upload example workspaces, and assets for the community to use. Project pages give people the exact tutorial that I made on the YouTube channel. You can [search by all](https://github.com/MCreator-Examples/Projects/discussions?discussions_q=) the categories in the discussions tab or by specific categories to find something you looking for. If you don't find what you are looking for you can use the feedback repository to share a request for a future tutorial on my YouTube Channel.

## üí° FEEDBACK
The [Feedback Repository](https://github.com/MCreator-Examples/Feedback) is a place where the community can suggest ideas for future videos. In some cases, I will pick things from this repository if I feel motivated or have an idea of how to add them. After which a tutorial will be made for the YouTube channel and then a project page will be made if one is needed for the request. I recommend searching before you post your suggestion and I encourage people to comment on existing posts of similar ideas to make less work for me to filter through the ideas people have submitted. If it's been suggested already the issue may be closed and directed to one that already was open.

## üåé TALE OF BIOMES
[Tale of Biomes Repository](https://github.com/MCreator-Examples/Tale-of-Biomes) is a Minecraft mod that I am working on as part of the MCreator Lore series on my YouTube channel NorthWestTrees MCreator. Tale of Biomes adds a new dimension and an entirely new custom world full of new mechanics and features that expand the game's reach. Here you will find snapshots, releases, and documentation for the modification.
